  <h2>About</h2>
  <small>This space will evolve - for now, an understated introduction to my work leading technology delivery, enabling digital trust, 
    and shaping transformation through governance.</small>
    <p>I lead technology delivery and governance at Beyond Blue - building systems and teams that are as dependable as they are adaptive.</p>

  <p>Over the past two decades, I’ve worked across strategy, systems, and delivery - from hands-on implementation to enterprise leadership. My current focus sits where technology, 
    people, and trust intersect.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of work, I build quietly: projects like LucidSeal and ThreatScope Check explore how visibility, privacy, and resilience can coexist online</p>
