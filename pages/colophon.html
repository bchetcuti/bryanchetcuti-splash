      <h2>Colophon & Digital Trust</h2>
  
      <p>This site isn’t about promotion - it’s about presence.  
         A single page that says: I stand behind what I build, and how I build it.</p>
  
      <p>It exists to be small, fast, and durable.  
         Hand-written in <strong>vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.  
         Served through <strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> with HTTPS enforced and caching controlled.  
         No frameworks. No cookies. No dependencies I can’t explain.</p>
  
      <p>Typography is set in <em>Space Grotesk</em> and <em>Inter</em> - clear, modern, legible.  
         Colours draw from a palette built for calm contrast: ink, paper, and the occasional accent of energy.</p>  
         <p>Design intent: minimal surface, maximal clarity.</i></p>
  
      <p>Every line of code was written with the same philosophy I bring to my work in technology delivery and governance -  
         trust through transparency, security through simplicity, and accountability through design.  
         You can <a href="https://github.com/bchetcuti/bryanchetcuti-splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view the source</a>,  
         fork it, or read it line by line. There’s nothing hidden behind the curtain.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Privacy & data:</strong> This site collects nothing. No cookies, pixels, analytics, or logs that identify visitors.  
         If you reach out to collaborate, it’s person-to-person - not profile-to-algorithm.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Resilience:</strong> Hosted on a redundant global edge network.  
         Backed up offline. Tested for performance, accessibility, and integrity.  
         Built to remain readable, even if everything else breaks.</p>

      <p><strong>Commitment:</strong> Digital trust isn’t just a topic - it’s a practice.  
         It’s built into every choice, from open repositories to plain-language policies.  
         Whether it’s code, content, or collaboration, the principle stays the same:  
         <em>trust must be earned, not assumed.</em></p>
